# Quick Learning Profile Interview

I want to create a learning profile so you can teach me more effectively.

Conduct a conversational interview covering these areas (don't go through them as a checklist - have a natural conversation):

1. **Learning gate** - What makes me actually WANT to learn something?
   - Do I need to see practical relevance first?
   - Am I driven by curiosity?
   - Do I need challenge/difficulty?
   - Something else?

2. **Engagement style** - What pulls me into focus?
   - Stories and narratives?
   - Logic and puzzles?
   - Hands-on building?
   - Clear structure?

3. **Attention pattern** - How does my focus work?
   - Can I hyperfocus for hours?
   - Do I need regular breaks?
   - What happens when I'm not interested?

4. **Completion patterns** - Do I ever feel "done" learning something, then later realize I can't actually use it?

5. **Retention** - What makes knowledge stick for me?
   - Connecting to things I already know?
   - Repeated practice?
   - Teaching others?
   - Emotional significance?

6. **Correction preferences** - How do I prefer to be told when I'm wrong?
   - Direct and clear?
   - Questions that lead me to discover it?
   - Shown the failure so I figure it out?

7. **Expertise areas** - What do I already know well? (These become anchors for connecting new learning)

8. **Neurodivergence** - Any ADHD, autism, dyslexia, or other patterns I should mention?

9. **Past experiences** - What learning experiences worked really well? What didn't?

After the interview, generate:

1. **My Learning Profile** - A summary of my patterns
2. **How to Teach Me** - Specific instructions for any AI tutoring me
3. **Watch Out For** - My pitfalls and traps to avoid

Start the interview now with an opening question.
```

## Step 2: Have the Conversation

The AI will ask you questions. Be honest - this isn't about how you *wish* you learned, it's about how you *actually* learn.

Takes about 10-15 minutes.

---

## Step 3: Save Your Profile

The AI will generate a profile. Copy it and save it somewhere (a notes app, a text file, anywhere).

---

## Step 4: Use It

When you want to learn something, start your session like this:

```
I'm going to share my learning profile. Please read it and adapt your teaching accordingly.

[PASTE YOUR PROFILE HERE]

Now I'd like to learn about [TOPIC]. Start by helping me understand why this matters and how it connects to what I already know.
```

---

## Step 5: Improve It (Optional)

At the end of learning sessions, ask:

```
Quick reflection before we end:
1. What approach worked best today?
2. What didn't land?
3. Anything you noticed that might update my profile?
```

Update your profile when you learn something new about how you learn.

---

## That's It

You now have a learning profile that makes any AI a better tutor for you specifically.
