## Instructions for the AI

You are a Learning Profile Architect. Your job is to conduct a warm, conversational interview to understand how someone learns best, then generate a comprehensive learning profile they can use with any AI tutor.

### Your Approach

1. **Be conversational, not clinical** - This should feel like a good chat, not a medical intake form
2. **Explore stories** - Ask for specific examples and experiences, not just preferences
3. **Notice patterns** - Look for consistencies and contradictions in what they share
4. **Be curious** - Follow interesting threads; the best insights come from tangents
5. **Validate** - Reflect back what you're hearing to make sure you understand

### The Interview Structure

Cover these areas through natural conversation (don't go through them as a checklist):

**Opening:** Start with something like "Tell me about a time you learned something really well - something that stuck with you. What was it and why do you think it worked?"

**IMPORTANT: Discover, Don't Assume**

People learn in vastly different ways. Don't assume everyone needs:
- Relevance framing first (some are curiosity-driven or challenge-driven)
- Frequent verification (some learners are highly self-aware)
- Connection to existing knowledge (some prefer clean-slate learning)
- Emotional check-ins (some find this distracting)

Your job is to DISCOVER their patterns, not confirm a template.

**Areas to Explore:**

1. **The Gate** - What opens the door to learning for them?
   - Relevance? ("I need to know what I'll DO with this")
   - Curiosity? ("I just find it interesting")
   - Challenge? ("I want to master something hard")
   - Social? ("Others are counting on me")
   - Structure? ("I need to see the whole picture first")
   - Obligation? ("I have to, so I will")
   - *Ask: "When do you WANT to learn vs. when do you resist it?"*

2. **Engagement Style** - What pulls them into flow?
   - Stories and narrative?
   - Logic and puzzles?
   - Hands-on building?
   - Competition or challenge?
   - Free exploration?
   - Clear structure and rules?
   - *Ask: "Describe when you lost track of time learning something."*

3. **Attention Pattern** - How does their focus work?
   - Hyperfocus capable? Or steady moderate focus?
   - Needs breaks? Or interruptions break flow?
   - Time-aware or time-blind when engaged?
   - *Ask: "What happens to your sense of time when you're learning something engaging?"*

4. **Completion Patterns** - How do they know they've learned something?
   - Do they sometimes feel "done" prematurely?
   - Does finishing feel like learning? (completion trap)
   - Are they self-aware about their understanding?
   - *Some learners DON'T have this trap - don't assume they do*
   - *Ask: "Have you ever finished a course and later realized you couldn't actually use it?"*

5. **Retention** - What makes knowledge stick?
   - Connections to existing knowledge?
   - Repeated practice?
   - Emotional significance?
   - Teaching others?
   - Visual memory?
   - Physical/hands-on memory?
   - *Ask: "Tell me something you learned years ago that you still remember. Why did it stick?"*

6. **Correction Preferences** - How do they handle being wrong?
   - Direct correction?
   - Socratic questions to self-discover?
   - Shown the failure to figure out why?
   - Does timing matter (early vs. late correction)?
   - Does context matter (private vs. public)?
   - *Ask: "Think of a time someone corrected you and it went well. What made it work?"*

7. **Modalities** - How do they prefer to take in information?
   - Reading
   - Video
   - Audio/podcasts
   - Conversation/discussion
   - Hands-on/building
   - Games/challenges
   - *Don't assume - some people hate their "supposed" preferred modality*
   - *Ask: "If you had to learn something important, how would you choose to learn it?"*

8. **Expertise Areas** - What do they already know well?
   - Professional domains
   - Hobbies with deep knowledge
   - Technologies/tools
   - *These become anchors for new learning*

9. **Learning Differences** - Any neurodivergence or other patterns?
   - ADHD, autism, dyslexia, etc.
   - Only if they want to share
   - Ask about PATTERNS, not labels
   - *Ask: "Is there anything about how your brain works that's helpful for me to know?"*

10. **Past Experiences** - What worked and what didn't?
    - Best learning experiences - what made them work?
    - Worst learning experiences - what went wrong?
    - Teachers/styles that clicked or didn't
    - *This often reveals the most about their patterns*

### Common Learner Archetypes (For Recognition)

These are patterns to recognize, not boxes to force people into. Many learners are combinations.

| Archetype | Gate | Engagement | Verification Needs |
|-----------|------|------------|-------------------|
| **Relevance-Gated** | "What can I DO with this?" | Application-focused | Frequent - may have completion trap |
| **Curiosity-Driven** | "This is interesting!" | Exploration, tangents | Light - usually self-aware |
| **Challenge-Seeker** | "This is hard!" | Competition, mastery | Through harder problems |
| **Structure-First** | "Show me the whole picture" | Clear roadmaps, order | Checkpoint-based |
| **Social Learner** | "Others need me to know this" | Discussion, teaching | Through explaining to others |
| **Hands-On Builder** | "Let me try it" | Building, experimenting | Through successful creation |
| **Theory-First** | "I need to understand why" | Deep explanation first | Through logical consistency |
| **Example-First** | "Show me one first" | Concrete before abstract | Through pattern matching |

**Combinations are common:** Someone might be relevance-gated AND hands-on, or curiosity-driven AND structure-first.

**Watch for contradictions:** These reveal nuance. "I love exploring BUT I need a roadmap" = curiosity-driven with structure needs.

### Generating the Profile

After the conversation, create a profile in the format shown at the end of this document. Include:

- A clear summary of their learner type
- Specific notes for any AI that will teach them
- Their "anchor library" - expertise that can connect to new learning
- Watch-out patterns and what works/doesn't work

## Start the Interview

Hi! I'm here to help you understand how you learn best, so you can get more out of any learning experience - whether with me, another AI, or on your own.

There are no wrong answers. We're just going to have a conversation about your experiences with learning - what's worked, what hasn't, and how your brain seems to operate.

**Let's start with a story.** Think back to something you learned that really stuck with you - maybe a skill, a concept, anything. Not just something you memorized for a test, but something that became part of how you think or work.

What was it? And what made that learning experience work?

## How to Teach Me (Tutor Guide)

**IMPORTANT: This section should be GENERATED from your profile, not copied as-is.**

After creating your profile, ask the AI:

> "Based on my learning profile above, generate a custom 'How to Teach Me' tutor guide. Include specific instructions for:
> 1. How to open sessions with me
> 2. What must happen BEFORE teaching content (my learning gate)
> 3. How to keep me engaged (based on my engagement style)
> 4. How often to verify understanding (based on my completion trap risk)
> 5. How to correct me when I'm wrong (based on my correction preferences)
> 6. What signals show I'm disengaging (based on my attention pattern)
> 7. How to handle it when I'm struggling or frustrated
> 8. How to end sessions with me
>
> Make it specific to MY patterns, not generic advice."

The AI will generate a tutor guide customized to YOUR profile. Paste that generated guide here.

### Example: What a Generated Tutor Guide Looks Like

Here's what a tutor guide might look like for different learner types:

**For a Relevance-Gated Learner:**
```
Opening: Frame WHY this matters before any content. I cannot engage until I see practical application.
Gate: Answer "What can I DO with this?" first. No relevance = no learning.
Verification: Check frequently - I may feel "done" before I've truly learned.
```

**For a Curiosity-Driven Learner:**
```
Opening: Hook me with something interesting or surprising about the topic.
Gate: Spark curiosity - "Here's something weird/cool about this..."
Verification: I'll ask questions when engaged - silence may mean I'm bored, not confused.
```

**For a Challenge-Driven Learner:**
```
Opening: Frame this as a problem to solve or a skill to master.
Gate: Make it hard enough to be interesting. Too easy = disengaged.
Verification: Give me harder problems to test myself - I want to prove mastery.
```

**For a Structure-Driven Learner:**
```
Opening: Show me the roadmap - what we'll cover and in what order.
Gate: I need to see the whole picture before diving into pieces.
Verification: Check off progress visibly - I want to see where we are.
```

Ready to start? Begin by acknowledging you've read my profile and tutor guide, then open the session using MY specific approach.
```

### Step 3: Keep It Updated

After each session, update your project file:

1. **Progress Log** - What you covered, how well you understood it
2. **Topics to Cover** - Check off completed, add new ones discovered
3. **Anchors** - Add new connections you discovered
4. **Questions** - Remove answered, add new ones

### Example: Filled Out Session Starter

```markdown
# Session Starter: Azure Architecture

## My Learning Profile

[Full profile here...]

---

## Current Project: Azure Architecture

**Learning Goal:** Understand Azure well enough to architect hybrid cloud solutions for enterprise clients.

**Why It Matters:** My company is moving clients to Azure. I need to lead these migrations. This directly impacts my job and my team depends on me knowing this.

**Where I Am:**
- Completed: Azure fundamentals, identity basics
- Current: Networking (VNets, peering, hybrid connectivity)
- Struggling with: When to use VPN Gateway vs ExpressRoute

**Anchors:**
- On-prem AD (20 years): Azure AD is cloud-hosted version, hybrid scenarios map to my federation experience
- VMware/Hyper-V: Azure VMs are same concepts, different interface
- Networking (VLANs, firewalls): VNets = VLANs, NSGs = firewall rules

**This Session:** I want to understand VNet peering vs VPN Gateway - when to use which.

---

## Instructions for Tutor

1. Read my learning profile and adapt your teaching style
2. Start by framing WHY today's topic matters for my goal
3. Connect new concepts to my anchor expertise listed above
4. Check my understanding through application, not "does that make sense?"
5. Watch for my disengagement signals and pivot if needed
6. End with: what we covered, what connected, what needs reinforcement

Ready? Let's start with VNet peering vs VPN Gateway.
```

## Quick Reference: File Structure

For ongoing learning, organize like this:

```
my-learning/
├── MY_LEARNING_PROFILE.md      # Your generated profile (update occasionally)
├── azure-project/
│   ├── SESSION_STARTER.md      # Reusable prompt for this project
│   ├── progress.md             # Detailed progress notes
│   └── session-logs/           # Individual session notes
├── react-project/
│   ├── SESSION_STARTER.md
│   └── ...
└── PROFILE_CREATOR.md          # This file (for creating new profiles)
```

---

## Continuous Improvement System

Your profile should evolve. Here's how to keep it alive:

### After Every Session: Quick Reflection

At the end of each learning session, ask the AI:

> "Before we end, let's do a quick session reflection:
> 1. What approach worked best today?
> 2. What didn't land or needed pivoting?
> 3. Did you notice anything about how I learn that might update my profile?
> 4. Any suggestions for my tutor guide based on this session?"

**Log what you learn** in your project's progress notes or your profile's Evolution Log.

### The AI Should Proactively Notice

Include this in your session starter or tutor guide:

```
CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT INSTRUCTION:

As we work together, actively notice:
- When something lands really well → note what made it work
- When something doesn't click → note what approach failed
- When I respond unexpectedly → my profile might need updating
- When my stated preferences don't match my actual responses

At session end (or when you notice something significant), tell me:
"I noticed [observation]. This might mean [insight]. Should we update your profile?"

Don't just follow my profile blindly - help me improve it.
```

### Monthly Profile Review

Once a month (or when things feel off), run a profile review:

> "Let's review my learning profile. I'm going to share it with you, and I want you to:
> 1. Ask me if anything feels outdated or wrong
> 2. Ask about any life changes that might affect my learning
> 3. Check if my stated preferences still match how I actually respond
> 4. Suggest any updates based on our recent sessions
> 5. Update my 'Current State' section
>
> Here's my profile: [paste profile]"

### What Triggers a Profile Update?

**Update immediately when:**
- Something in the profile is clearly wrong
- A new pattern emerges (happened 3+ times)
- Life circumstances significantly change
- You discover a new anchor/expertise area

**Review and possibly update when:**
- An approach that used to work stops working
- You notice yourself responding differently than profile predicts
- Stress/energy levels have shifted for extended period
- You've completed a major learning project (new expertise)

### Version Your Profile

When you make significant updates:

```markdown
**Version:** 1.3
**Last Major Update:** [Date]
**Change:** Added structure-first need discovered during Azure learning

## Change History
- v1.3 (date): Discovered I need roadmaps for complex topics
- v1.2 (date): Updated correction preferences - more direct is fine now
- v1.1 (date): Added Docker/K8s to expertise anchors
- v1.0 (date): Initial profile created
```

### Seasonal/Life Phase Awareness

Your learning capacity changes. Update your "Current State" when:

- Starting a new job or project (capacity drops, stress rises)
- Going through personal challenges (adjust expectations)
- In a good flow period (can push harder)
- Burned out (need gentler approach, smaller chunks)
- Excited about a topic (leverage the motivation)

The AI should adapt to where you ARE, not where your profile says you usually are.

### The Meta-Learning Loop

Over time, you'll learn about how you learn. Capture this:

```markdown
## Meta-Learning Insights

Things I've discovered about myself:

- [Date]: I thought I was X, but actually I'm Y when...
- [Date]: The approach that works for topic A doesn't work for topic B because...
- [Date]: My energy pattern is actually... not what I thought
- [Date]: I need more/less verification than I originally said because...
```

This is the real value - you're not just getting taught, you're understanding yourself better.

## Quick Start Checklist

1. [ ] Create your profile using the interview
2. [ ] Generate your custom tutor guide
3. [ ] Create a session starter for your current learning project
4. [ ] Add the "Continuous Improvement Instruction" to your tutor guide
5. [ ] Do a quick reflection after each session
6. [ ] Review profile monthly or when things feel off
7. [ ] Update Current State before sessions when life circumstances change

---

## Advanced Topics

### Quick Start: Minimum Viable Profile

If the full process feels overwhelming, start here:

> "I want to create a quick learning profile. Ask me these 5 questions:
> 1. Tell me about the best learning experience you've ever had. What made it work?
> 2. What makes you NOT want to learn something?
> 3. How do you prefer to be told when you're wrong?
> 4. What do you already know well that we can connect new learning to?
> 5. Anything about how your brain works I should know?
>
> Then create a simple profile I can expand later."

You can always deepen it through the full interview later.

---

### Emotional Blockers & Learning Baggage

Some topics carry emotional weight. Add this to your profile if relevant:

```markdown
## Learning Blockers

**Topics with baggage:**
| Topic | The Baggage | What Helps |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| [e.g., Math] | [Bad teacher in school, felt stupid] | [Start with wins, no pressure] |
| [e.g., Public speaking] | [Embarrassing failure] | [Private practice first] |

**General patterns:**
- Imposter syndrome: [None/Mild/Significant] - [How it shows up]
- Fear of looking stupid: [None/Mild/Significant] - [Triggers]
- Perfectionism blocking: [None/Mild/Significant] - [How to work with it]
- Past failures affecting: [Specific areas]
```

**Add this to the interview:**
> "Are there any topics or skills where you have negative associations or past bad experiences? Sometimes our history with a subject affects how we learn it."

---

### The "Stuck" Protocol

When nothing is working, use this diagnostic:

```markdown
## When Learning Isn't Landing

Ask yourself (or have the AI ask):

**1. Is the gate open?**
- Do I actually care about this right now?
- Is the relevance/curiosity/challenge present?
- If not → reframe WHY this matters, or pause until it does

**2. Is it the content or is it me?**
- Am I tired/stressed/distracted?
- Is my current state blocking learning?
- If yes → address the state first, not the content

**3. Is the approach wrong?**
- Has the tutor tried multiple modalities?
- Am I forcing a mode that isn't working today?
- If yes → switch approach dramatically

**4. Is there a hidden blocker?**
- Is there emotional baggage about this topic?
- Am I afraid of something (failure, looking stupid)?
- If yes → address the feeling before the content

**5. Is this the wrong time?**
- Some topics need incubation time
- Sometimes walking away and returning helps
- If nothing works → take a real break, not a "try harder" break

**Recovery Protocol:**
1. Acknowledge what's happening without judgment
2. Diagnose which of the above is the issue
3. Address that specific issue
4. Start smaller than you think you need to
5. Get one small win before pushing forward
```

### Cross-Session Continuity

AIs don't remember between sessions. Here's how to maintain context:

**Option 1: Session Log Handoff**
At end of each session, ask:
> "Summarize this session for future me: what we covered, what clicked, what's fuzzy, where to start next time."

Save this and include it in your next session starter.

**Option 2: Project Progress File**
Keep a running document:
```markdown
## Learning Continuity: [Project]

### Last Session: [Date]
- Covered: [Topics]
- Key insights: [What clicked]
- Still fuzzy: [What needs more work]
- Next session: [Where to start]

### Knowledge Built So Far
- [Concept 1]: Solid understanding
- [Concept 2]: Basic grasp, needs reinforcement
- [Concept 3]: Introduced but not clicked yet

### Connections Made
- [New thing] connects to [old anchor] because [reason]
```

Include relevant portions in your session starter.

**Option 3: Spaced Repetition Notes**
For important concepts, note when to review:
```markdown
## Review Schedule
| Concept | Learned | Review 1 (1 day) | Review 2 (1 week) | Review 3 (1 month) |
|---------|---------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| [X] | [date] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
```

### Different Learning Contexts

Your needs may differ based on context. Consider adding:

```markdown
## Context-Specific Notes

### High-Stakes Learning (Certification, Job Requirement)
- Pressure affects me by: [How]
- I need more/less: [What changes]
- Deadline behavior: [How I respond to pressure]

### Casual/Hobby Learning
- Different because: [What changes]
- I can tolerate more: [Exploration? Tangents? Ambiguity?]

### Technical vs. Creative Learning
- Technical: I prefer [approach]
- Creative: I prefer [different approach]

### Self-Study vs. Tutored
- Alone, I tend to: [Patterns]
- With a tutor, I need: [What helps]
```

---

### Skill Level Evolution

How you learn changes as you level up. Track this:

```markdown
## Level-Specific Patterns

### When I'm a Beginner
- I need: [More structure? More examples? Permission to be bad?]
- I struggle with: [Overwhelm? Not knowing what I don't know?]
- What helps: [Specific approaches]

### When I'm Intermediate
- I need: [Harder challenges? Edge cases? Deeper why?]
- I struggle with: [Plateau? Overconfidence? Gaps?]
- What helps: [Specific approaches]

### When I'm Advanced
- I need: [Nuance? Exceptions? Teaching others?]
- I struggle with: [Boredom? Finding new challenges?]
- What helps: [Specific approaches]
```

**Add this to the interview:**
> "Do you notice yourself learning differently when you're a complete beginner versus when you already know the basics?"

### Celebrating Progress & Wins

Don't just track problems. Track wins:

```markdown
## Wins Log

| Date | Win | Why It Matters |
|------|-----|----------------|
| | Something clicked | Builds confidence |
| | Applied knowledge successfully | Proves real learning |
| | Pushed through difficulty | Resilience |
| | Made unexpected connection | Knowledge web growing |

## Momentum Indicators
- Current streak: [X sessions without major struggle]
- Confidence level: [Rising/Stable/Shaky]
- Excitement about learning: [High/Medium/Low]
```

**Ask the AI to notice:**
> "When I have a win or breakthrough, explicitly acknowledge it. I want to build a wins log, not just track problems."

---

### Returning After a Break

If you haven't learned in a while:

```markdown
## Re-Engagement Protocol

When returning after [days/weeks/months]:

1. **Don't jump back in where you left off**
   - Review what you covered before
   - Check what stuck vs. faded
   - Rebuild foundation if needed

2. **Update Current State**
   - Energy/capacity now
   - Life circumstances now
   - Any changes since last session

3. **Start smaller than you think**
   - Momentum matters more than progress
   - One small win rebuilds confidence
   - Don't try to "make up for lost time"

4. **Check if profile still fits**
   - Long breaks sometimes mean you've changed
   - Quick validation: "Does this still sound like me?"
```

**Prompt for returning:**
> "I haven't done any learning in [time period]. Let's ease back in:
> 1. Quick check-in on how I'm doing
> 2. Review what I remember from before
> 3. Identify what's faded and what stuck
> 4. Start with something small to rebuild momentum
>
> Here's my profile and where I left off: [paste]"

---

### Profile Validation

How do you know your profile is accurate?

**Signs your profile might be wrong:**
- AI follows it but learning still doesn't click
- You find yourself thinking "that's not quite right"
- Your actual responses don't match stated preferences
- What worked before stops working (and it's not life circumstances)

**Validation exercise:**
> "I want to validate my learning profile. I'm going to describe some scenarios, and I want you to predict how I'd respond based on my profile. Then I'll tell you if the prediction is right.
>
> Scenario 1: You're explaining a concept and I say 'yeah, I get it' quickly.
> Scenario 2: You correct a misconception I've held for a while.
> Scenario 3: The topic feels dry and irrelevant to me.
>
> Predict my responses, then I'll tell you if that's accurate."

**Profile debugging:**
If something's not working, ask:
> "My profile says [X], but I notice [Y behavior]. Let's explore:
> - Is my profile wrong?
> - Is this situation different?
> - Did something change?
> - Am I in a different state than usual?"

### Sharing Your Profile with Human Teachers

Your profile works for human tutors too. Consider creating a shorter version:

```markdown
## Quick Guide for Human Teachers/Tutors

**In one sentence:** [Your learner type summary]

**Before teaching me anything:**
[What must happen first - your gate]

**What works:**
- [Approach 1]
- [Approach 2]

**What doesn't work:**
- [Approach 1]
- [Approach 2]

**How I prefer to be corrected:**
[Short version]

**What to watch for:**
[Disengagement signals]

**My expertise you can connect to:**
[Key anchors]
```
