# Example Learning Profiles

These show how different people's profiles can look. Yours will be unique to you.

---

## Example 1: Relevance-Gated, Hands-On Learner

```markdown
# Learning Profile: Alex

## Quick Summary

**Learner Type:** Relevance-gated, hands-on, hyperfocus-capable

**Core Pattern:** Cannot engage with content until "What can I DO with this?" is answered. Once the gate opens, can focus for hours.

**The Key Insight:** Frame practical application FIRST, or the door stays closed.

---

## How to Teach This Person

### Before Starting Any Topic
Must answer "Why does this matter?" and "What will I be able to do?" before any content. Don't assume relevance is obvious - state it explicitly.

### During Teaching
- Connect everything to hands-on application
- Use existing expertise as anchors (20 years IT)
- Stories help for dry topics
- Let them try things, don't just explain

### Checking Understanding
Check frequently. Alex may feel "done" before truly understanding. Ask for application to new scenarios, not just "does that make sense?"

### Correcting Mistakes
Direct is fine when confident. Gentler when struggling - affirm what's right before correcting.

---

## Learning Gates
**Primary Gate:** Relevance - "What can I DO with this?"

---

## Completion & Self-Awareness
**Completion trap risk:** High
**Pattern:** Figuring it out feels like learning it. May move on before knowledge is solid.
**Mitigation:** Require application, not just explanation. "Walk me through how you'd use this."

---

## Expertise & Anchors

| Domain | Level | Good For Anchoring... |
|--------|-------|----------------------|
| Active Directory | Expert | Identity concepts, federation, cloud IAM |
| PowerShell | Expert | Automation, scripting, infrastructure as code |
| Networking | Advanced | Cloud networking, distributed systems |
| SQL/Databases | Advanced | Data concepts, query optimization |

---

## What Works / What Doesn't

### What Works Well
- Frame relevance immediately
- Connect to IT experience
- Hands-on exercises
- Story-based framing for dry topics

### What Doesn't Work
- Abstract theory without application
- "Trust me, this will be useful later"
- Long explanations before doing
- Interrupting hyperfocus

---

## Current State
**Energy/Capacity:** Medium
**Life stress:** Moderate (new project ramping up)
**Available focus:** Good in mornings, fragmented afternoons
```

## Example 2: Curiosity-Driven Explorer

```markdown
# Learning Profile: Jordan

## Quick Summary

**Learner Type:** Curiosity-driven, exploration-focused, self-aware

**Core Pattern:** Learns by following interesting threads. Doesn't need external motivation - genuine interest is the engine.

**The Key Insight:** Spark curiosity, then get out of the way. Don't over-structure.

---

## How to Teach This Person

### Before Starting Any Topic
Hook with something interesting, surprising, or weird about the topic. "Here's something cool about this..." works better than "Here's why you need this."

### During Teaching
- Allow tangents - they often lead to deeper understanding
- Share the "why behind the why"
- Embrace complexity - Jordan doesn't need things simplified
- Offer rabbit holes to explore

### Checking Understanding
Light touch. Jordan is self-aware about understanding. Silence usually means thinking, not confusion. Only verify when they seem uncertain.

### Correcting Mistakes
Loves being corrected - sees it as interesting new information, not failure. Be direct.

---

## Learning Gates
**Primary Gate:** Curiosity - "This is interesting!"

---

## Completion & Self-Awareness
**Completion trap risk:** Low
**Self-assessment accuracy:** High - knows when understanding is solid vs. shallow
**Pattern:** Will actually say "I don't fully get this yet" without prompting

---

## What Works / What Doesn't

### What Works Well
- Interesting hooks and surprising facts
- Deep dives into "why"
- Freedom to explore tangents
- Complex, nuanced explanations

### What Doesn't Work
- Over-simplified explanations
- Rigid structure that prevents exploration
- Forced relevance framing (curiosity is enough)
- Frequent check-ins (feels patronizing)
```

---

## Example 3: Structure-First, Methodical Learner

```markdown
# Learning Profile: Sam

## Quick Summary

**Learner Type:** Structure-first, methodical, checkpoint-driven

**Core Pattern:** Needs to see the whole map before exploring any territory. Ambiguity is uncomfortable.

**The Key Insight:** Show the roadmap first. "Here's everything we'll cover and in what order."

---

## How to Teach This Person

### Before Starting Any Topic
Provide structure: What are we covering? In what order? How do the pieces connect? How will we know when we're done?

### During Teaching
- Clear progression through topics
- Explicit transitions: "Now we're moving from X to Y"
- Visual roadmaps when possible
- Check off completed items

### Checking Understanding
Checkpoint-based. "We've covered A, B, C. Solid on all of those before we move to D?"

### Correcting Mistakes
Prefers clear, direct correction. Ambiguous feedback is frustrating.

---

## Learning Gates
**Primary Gate:** Structure - "Show me the whole picture first"

---

## Completion & Self-Awareness
**Completion trap risk:** Low
**Pattern:** Won't feel done until the roadmap is complete. May actually over-learn (keep going when done).
**Note:** Might need permission to move on: "This is solid enough, let's continue."

---

## What Works / What Doesn't

### What Works Well
- Clear outlines and roadmaps
- Numbered steps
- Explicit progress tracking
- "We're 60% through the core concepts"

### What Doesn't Work
- "Let's see where this goes"
- Tangents without warning
- Undefined scope
- Jumping between topics

---

## Context-Specific Notes

### High-Stakes Learning
Structure needs increase. Wants very clear success criteria.

### Casual Learning
Can relax structure somewhat, but still wants a general outline.
```

---

## Example 4: Challenge-Driven Competitor

```markdown
# Learning Profile: Morgan

## Quick Summary

**Learner Type:** Challenge-driven, competitive, mastery-focused

**Core Pattern:** Boredom is the enemy. Needs difficulty to stay engaged. Easy = disengaged.

**The Key Insight:** Make it hard enough to be interesting. Frame as challenges to beat.

---

## How to Teach This Person

### Before Starting Any Topic
Frame as a challenge: "This is tricky. Most people struggle with X part." or "Let's see if you can figure this out."

### During Teaching
- Escalating difficulty
- Problems to solve, not just concepts to absorb
- Gamification works well
- Time challenges can increase engagement

### Checking Understanding
Through harder problems. "You got that. Here's a trickier version." Morgan will self-identify gaps through failed challenges.

### Correcting Mistakes
Very direct. Can handle "That's wrong, here's why" without softening. Might even appreciate the challenge.

---

## Learning Gates
**Primary Gate:** Challenge - "This is hard and I want to beat it"

---

## Completion & Self-Awareness
**Completion trap risk:** Medium
**Pattern:** May move on once "beaten" without ensuring retention
**Mitigation:** Frame retention itself as a challenge: "Can you still do this tomorrow?"

---

## What Works / What Doesn't

### What Works Well
- "This is advanced/tricky/challenging"
- Puzzles and problems
- Competition (against self, others, or clock)
- Mastery framing

### What Doesn't Work
- Too easy (immediate disengagement)
- Slow, methodical explanations
- Over-scaffolding
- Hand-holding

---

## Attention & Focus

**When interested:** Intense focus, competitive energy, wants to "win"
**When NOT interested:** Checks out completely. Will not push through boredom.
**Signals of disengagement:** Short answers, rushing, looking for shortcuts
```
