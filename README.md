# Learn Me

**Create a personal learning profile that teaches any AI how to teach YOU.**

Works with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or any AI. No sign-up, no app - just copy, paste, and have a conversation.

## The Problem

Every AI tutoring session starts from zero. The AI doesn't know:
- That you need to understand WHY something matters before you can focus
- That you have 20 years of experience to connect new concepts to
- That you sometimes feel "done" learning before you actually understand
- That you prefer direct correction when confident, but gentler feedback when struggling

So every session, you're teaching the AI how to teach you. Again.

## The Solution

A system that:
1. **Interviews you** to discover how you actually learn
2. **Generates a personal profile** capturing your patterns, preferences, and pitfalls
3. **Creates a custom tutor guide** telling any AI exactly how to teach YOU
4. **Evolves over time** with built-in feedback loops

---

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

Copy this into any AI:

```
I want to create a learning profile so you can teach me better. Interview me about:

1. My learning gate - What makes me WANT to learn? (Relevance? Curiosity? Challenge?)
2. Engagement style - What pulls me into focus? (Stories? Puzzles? Hands-on?)
3. Attention pattern - How does my focus work? (Hyperfocus? Need breaks?)
4. Completion patterns - Do I sometimes feel "done" before truly understanding?
5. Retention - What makes knowledge stick? (Connections? Practice? Teaching others?)
6. Correction preferences - How do I like being told I'm wrong?
7. Expertise areas - What do I already know well? (Anchors for new learning)
8. Past experiences - What teachers/approaches worked or didn't?

After the interview, create:
1. A learning profile summarizing my patterns
2. A "How to Teach Me" guide with specific instructions
3. What to watch out for (my pitfalls)

Start the interview now.
```

Save your generated profile. Paste it at the start of future learning sessions.

## What You Get

**A profile like this:**
```
Learner Type: Relevance-gated, hands-on, hyperfocus-capable

Primary Gate: Must answer "What can I DO with this?" before content lands

Completion Trap Risk: High - may feel "done" before truly understanding

Anchors: Active Directory, PowerShell, networking (20 years IT experience)
```

**A custom tutor guide:**
```
Opening: Frame WHY this matters before any content. No relevance = no engagement.
Verification: Check frequently - this learner may shortcut to "I got it."
When struggling: Affirm what's right before correcting. Back off pressure.
```

## Features

- **Discovers, doesn't assume** - Not everyone learns the same way
- **Handles different learner types** - Relevance-gated, curiosity-driven, challenge-seeking, structure-first, and more
- **Tracks your current state** - Bad week? Burned out? Tell the AI where you actually are
- **"Stuck" protocol** - Diagnostic for when nothing's working
- **Expertise anchors** - Connect new learning to what you already know
- **Continuous improvement** - Feedback loops to evolve your profile over time
- **Cross-session continuity** - Tools to maintain context since AI doesn't remember
- **Works with any AI** - It's just a prompt system

## How It Works

1. **Create your profile** - Paste the creator into any AI, have a 15-30 minute conversation
2. **Generate your tutor guide** - Ask the AI to create teaching instructions based on YOUR profile
3. **Use it** - Paste your profile + guide at the start of learning sessions
4. **Improve it** - Quick reflection after sessions, monthly reviews, update as you change

## Who This Is For

- Anyone using AI for learning
- People who've felt like AI tutoring is "almost there" but not quite right
- Neurodivergent learners (ADHD, autism, etc.) who need adapted approaches
- Self-directed learners who want to understand themselves better
- Anyone frustrated by starting from zero every AI session
